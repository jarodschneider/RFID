# RFID
Test of MFRC522 RFID module on Arduino UNO R3

Simple authentication demo based on UID: authorized lights up LED green, unauthorized red

This could be scaled up to do anything, not just light up a LED

Disclaimer: obviously using the card's UID as authentication is unsecure, as UID is easily changed/emulated. This demo is only meant to serve as my introduction to RFID and should NOT be used in any serious security applications
